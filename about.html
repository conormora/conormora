        <p class="about" style="font-size:1rem; text-align:left;"> Hi there! I am currently a junior at the University of California, Berkeley majoring in Computer Science (B.A.) and Business Administration (B.S.).
        I am interested in the intersection of technology and business; I aim to consult on the world's most pressing issues, and create organizations and products to solve them.
      <br> <br>
      During my past two years at UC Berkeley, I've been an Education Consultant, Event Planner, and Robotics Mentor for Pioneers in Engineering, co-taught the 80-person PiE Robotics DeCal,
      and am currently the External Vice President of ANova, a CS mentorship organization for under-resourced youth in the East Bay. I am also working as a COVID-19 Task Force Researcher
      where I am creating an epidemiological model (SAIR) to represent the disease dynamics of COVID-19. At UC Berkeley, I am currently co-founding a public policy think-tank.
      <br> <br>
      I have previously interned at URx/InternHacks (Software Engineering Intern, chosen out of 800+ applicants), Franklin Templeton Investments (Fintech Partnerships & Corporate Venture Capital Intern),
      Infima (Data Science Researcher Intern), Propel(x) (Product Marketing Consultant Intern), and GoodlyLabs (Software Development Intern). I am a Jacobs Institute Innovation Catalysts Grant Recipient (1 of the 8 Fall 2019 recipients) and have won
      the Best Future Vision Award in the FinTech division for my android app at InternHacks.
